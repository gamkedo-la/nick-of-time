<color=#ff6666>Player 1</color><br>What was that just now?
<color=#6666ff>Player 2</color><br>I did remember those clocks whirling around me.
<color=#ff6666>Player 1</color><br>Yeah, clocks... Where are we now?
<color=#6666ff>Player 2</color><br>I suggest you, stop talking in questions and find us a way out.
<color=#ff6666>Player 1</color><br>...
 
<color=#ffff01>Old man</color><br>Oho ho... Visitors!
<color=#ff6666>Player 1</color><br>Hey old man! Can you tell us the way to get outta here?
<color=#ffff01>Old man</color><br>You two are young and filled with energy. We would become a good family.
<color=#6666ff>Player 2</color><br>Thanks but we are in hurry. So please tell us where is the exit?
<color=#ffff00>Old man</color><br>Hohoho! There is no exit.
<color=#ff6666>Player 1</color><br>Huh?
<color=#ffff02>Old man</color><br>I also entered it like you guys and then, I am stuck to this place for years.
<color=#ffff02>Old man</color><br>The only way to go is up ahead. You see that gate.
<color=#6666ff>Player 2</color><br>Can you please open it for us?
<color=#ffff02>Old Man</color><br>You will regret going ahead. There is nothing ahead but...
<color=#ffff04>Old Man</color><br><color=#ff0000>DEATH!</color>
<color=#ff6666>Player 1</color><br>I have no problem with that... We will figure things out. Now, open the gate!
